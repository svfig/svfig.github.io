</span></span><span class ="txt4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I looked&nbsp; at oboe reeds and thought I can make better ones using the clear plastic sheets from sushi boxes. These plastic reed whistles show very interesting audio FFT spectrum. The spectrum has more than 10 overtones with equal strength. I have never seen spectrum like that in various music instruments.</span><span class ="txt0">&quot;<br>

<br>
</span></span><span class ="txt0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We try to stick to the schedule, in particular on Forth Day.&nbsp; Remember that schedule slip is sometimes unavoidable. If a guy's on a roll, one wouldn't want to interrupt.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in a while we shuffle things around, for whatever reason.&nbsp; It may be ill-considered, but it isn't malicious. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're desperate to see a particular thing at a particular time please mention it and we'll try to accommodate you.&nbsp; If we get enough of this sort of request,&nbsp; we'll institute a system of graft and corruption in order to accomodate the well-healed among you.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future Thoughts:&nbsp; --- Chuck Moore at EuroForth 2018<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We'll turn off the YouTube stream and watch ... YouTube<span class ="bold"><br>
<br>
&gt;</span> Euroforth 2018 was held on the outskirts of Edinburgh - at a venue in sight of the <br>
&gt;famous Forth Bridges (now 3 of them!). As this year is recognised as the <br>
&gt;50th Anniversary of Forth, Charles Moore was invited as Guest of Honour.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Chuck gave an after dinner speech - which has been captured on YouTube by <br>
&gt; Jaanus Poial. <br>
