</span>The Radeus Labs Model 8200 Antenna Control Unit enables satellite earth station antennas to accurately acquire and track geosynchronous satellites. It is designed to support robust, unattended operation for long periods of time. The RL8200 ACU is written entirely in Forth. The touch-panel user interface is in SwiftForth for Windows and three embedded modules (controller, encoder interface, and resolver interface) are all in SwiftX for ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers. The entire unit (including all four Forth applications) was designed and developed in less than six months.<span class ="bold"><br>

As we often see, shifting priorities delayed this project. Then a commercial project was introduce for $85 with FDA approval with a astonishingly innovative data interface. <br>
