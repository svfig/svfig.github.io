10:20 ---&nbsp; Warm-Up for the May FPGA Workshop --- C.H. Ting<br>
</span>&quot;1.&nbsp; A tutorial on Diamond IDE for the Brevia2 FPGA Kit, using eP8080 as an example.<br>
2.&nbsp; A short discussion on the user variables, variables and constants in the 8086eForth Model 2.03, which is greatly simplified from the original 8086eForth 1.01.<br>
3.&nbsp; A short report on my learning progress of Visual Basic on Visual Studio Community 2015.&quot;<span class ="bold"><br>
<br>
If you're having trouble getting the Diamond IDE to work, bring your laptop for one-on-one assistance!<br>
<br>
If you're going to participate in Ting's may workshop and have not contacted him, please do so!&nbsp; If you don't have his email,&nbsp; send to me (Kevin Appert).&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't want to email him, at least make contact at the meeting!!!<br>

</span>Sam will be beaming with pride...<br>
&gt;&gt; Agenda = I will provide a progress update, and briefly demo however much<br>
&gt;&gt; I've ported of eForth to the 64-bit RISC-V instruction set.&nbsp; If time<br>
&gt;&gt; permits, I'll talk about the few, but important, differences from eForth<br>

<br>
14:35&nbsp; --- Ruminations on Forth Text Processing --- Brad Nelson<br>
</span>Brad has a hard time with this &quot;two-line summary&quot; concept:<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.&quot; —Alan Perlis<br>
<br>
&gt;The &quot;secret sauce&quot; of the Perl programming language (with several antecedents)<br>
was built-in support for a small collection of types: strings, numbers, lists, and associative arrays that form a potent mini-domain for reasoning about text processing. This idea spread from there to form a core part of the value proposition of languages include Python, Lua, Ruby, Javascript, Bash, PHP, Tcl and many other scripting languages. The JSON data format, and its prevalence, highlights how pervasive this idiom is in contemporary computing.<br>
<br>
&gt;While this &quot;JSON&quot; type domain is imminently implementable in Forth (for example ffl, <a href="http://irdvo.github.io/ffl/),">http://irdvo.github.io/ffl/),</a> it is not a common Forth idiom. Why? Are there Forth-y alternatives? What should text processing look like in Forth? I'll explorer, ponder alternatives, and engage the collective wisdom of my audience in search of answers.<span class ="bold"><br>
