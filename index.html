10:20 --- Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel --- C.H. Ting<br>
</span>&quot;I am now reworking the pictures of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel Frescoes.&nbsp; I had to re-scan all the pictures at 600 dpi, and then stitch them together to form two giant photos, one for the ceiling, and one for the front wall.&nbsp; After that, I will slowly pan/zoom the photos to accompany Bach's B Minor Mass.&nbsp; I will show scanned pictures and the combined photos, and perhaps play a few selected movements of the Mass.&quot;<span class ="bold"><br>

<br>
15:10 --- Organizing 2016 with Forth --- Brad Nelson<br>
</span>The start of a new year is a good time to take stock, get organized, and plan ahead. Since antiquity, various systems have been devised to document, schedule, and prepare for the future. Unfortunately, the mind is a tricky thing to put in order, and the future a very hard thing indeed for which to plan.<br>
<br>
But little mouse, you are not alone,<br>
In proving foresight may be vain:<br>
The best laid schemes of mice and men<br>
Go often askew,<br>
And leave us nothing but grief and pain,<br>
For promised joy!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Robert Burns 1785<br>
<br>
&quot;Though many task scheduling problems are computationally intractable, and predicting what is best to do harder still, my own attempts to get organized have oft failed solely for want of a daily routine of record and reflection.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;While only time will tell, my latest hope is that proprietorship over the system used to organize my world will reinforce its use. To this end, come witness as I expound upon a planning system of my own devising, crafted from the best tools at hand in 2016: the Web, the Cloud, sketches in sparse hue, and the simplicity of Forth.&quot;<span class ="bold"><br>

16:00 --- Clean Up and Adjourn<br>

<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we try to stick to the schedule?&nbsp; Yes, most of the time.&nbsp; That said, everyone needs to realize that slip happens.&nbsp; Sometimes somebody runs a little long.&nbsp; Once in a while we shuffle things around.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're desperate to see a particular thing at a particular time please mention it and we'll try to accommodate you.<br>
